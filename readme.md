Rebound effect has been studied in these models. 

Major changes include 

1. Value chain scale emission were changed. 
2. Consumer preference was added. There is a equation which gives behavior that if the price of a product faced by the consumer increases both due to the increase in price as well as the increase in demand of products. 
THe budget of the consumer is fixed
3. THe rebound effect can be broken down into scales. While rebound in Value chain scale is low. The total rebound is much higher.
The change in these rebounds is because in total, many effects get added together to give the total rebound. 
Consumer, market effects as well as equipment scale design. 
5. As expected rebound effect should increase with increase of budgets. 
6. The negative sign is yet to be solved in the code. Be careful of the results when you try to draw a pareto. 
7. gams_sim_version 0 has the VC rebound. Version 2 has the total rebound.
